# PassGenerator
This is a 16 bit password generator made in rust.

The idea behind this project is make a 16 bits password
generator that is based on XOR codification.
**Description:**
  - The passwords will be generate using ASCII alphabet.
  - The user must choose a Key Word
  - The passwords will be saved using XOR codification with the Key Word as key.
  - The passwords saves will be stored on a .txt file that only could be
      decript using the user Key Word as decript key.
